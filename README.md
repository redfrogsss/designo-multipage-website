This is a multi-page website built with Next.js, TypeScript and integrated with Strapi CMS. It is part of a code challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/designo-multipage-website-G48K6rfUT).

This repo is the frontend part of the project. The backend part is in [this repo](https://github.com/redfrogsss/designo-multipage-website-backend).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
